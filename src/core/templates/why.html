  <h1>Why This Project</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Helping agencies prevent dangerous culvert failures with clear, data-driven ratings.
  </p>

  <!-- WHY CULVERTS MATTER -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Why Culverts Matter for Road Safety</h2>
    <p>
      Culverts are essential for moving water under roads and protecting the pavement above.
      When a culvert deteriorates or collapses, the effects can be sudden and severe:
      lane closures, washouts, and unsafe conditions for drivers.
      Even a single failure can disrupt traffic, damage infrastructure, and require costly,
      emergency repairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is motivated by the need to reduce those disasters. Instead of waiting
      for visible distress or a collapse, agencies need a practical way to spot culverts
      that are more likely to be in poor condition and prioritize them for inspection or
      intervention.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PURPOSE -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Purpose of the Platform</h2>
    <p>
      The Culvert Prediction Predictor is designed to give transportation
      agencies, municipal engineers, and researchers a fast, consistent way to estimate a
      culvert’s condition on a simple 1–5 scale using a small set of inputs such as
      material, shape, age, soil pH, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      With given input, our system returns:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li>A predicted 1–5 rating for the culvert’s overall condition.</li>
      <li>A list of the different models outputs to show any discrepancies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal is to give engineers a smarter starting for discussing risk, maintenance, and replacement priorities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACT -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Impact on Public Safety</h2>
    <p>
      When a culvert collapses, it can undermine the road above it, force unexpected closures,
      and put drivers, pedestrians, and first responders in danger. By highlighting higher-risk
      candidates sooner, this platform helps agencies move from reactive repairs after a
      failure to proactive maintenance before the road is compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li>A standardized 1–5 rating scale,</li>
      <li>Outputs from different models</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      makes it easier to explain decisions to supervisors, district managers, and the public.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- COST-EFFECTIVE PLANNING -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Cost-Effective Inspection and Maintenance Planning</h2>
    <p>
      Agencies often manage thousands of culverts with limited crews and budgets. Fixed-cycle
      inspections treat every structure the same, even though some are far more likely to be in
      poor condition than others. This tool supports risk-aware scheduling by pointing
      engineers toward the culverts most likely to need attention first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the platform is lightweight and browser-based, planners can:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li>Run quick ratings in the field or at the office using data they already have.</li>
      <li>Compare “what-if” scenarios when considering materials or replacement options.</li>
      <li>Export PDFs to support budget requests, planning memos, or design reports.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHO BENEFITS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Who This Helps</h2>
    <p>
      The platform is built for:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple-list">
      <li>
        Field engineers who need quick, defensible ratings during site visits,
        along with PDFs they can attach to inspection notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        District planners who need to screen many culverts and prioritize
        follow-up inspections, repairs, or replacements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consultants and researchers who want transparent, repeatable ratings
        to support memos, studies, and design recommendations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Across all of these roles, the goal is the same: fewer surprises, fewer dangerous
      failures, and safer roads for the public.
