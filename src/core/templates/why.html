  <h1>Why This Project</h1>

    Purpose, public safety impact, and cost-effective inspection planning.
  </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Agencies manage large inventories of culverts with limited budgets. A
      consistent, explainable, and fast screening tool helps triage
      structures and standardize communications.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Impact on Public Safety</h2>
    <p>
      By highlighting higher-risk candidates sooner, the platform supports
      proactive maintenance and reduces the chance of failures affecting
      roads and communities. The 1–5 rating and probability view make risk
      easier to communicate.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Cost-Effective Inspection Planning</h2>
    <p>
      Using lightweight, browser-based inputs, planners can prioritize
      inspections and allocate crews where the expected benefit is
      highest—without heavy workflows or new logins.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Notes</h2>
    <p>
      The UI emphasizes clarity and speed with clean pages, consistent
      layout, and simple guidance. Export to PDF supports recordkeeping and
      sharing of results.
